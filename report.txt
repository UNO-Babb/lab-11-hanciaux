I changed the time it takes for a shopper to collect an item from just 30 seconds to a time between 20 seconds and a minute. 
I also changed the time between shoppers from one arriving every 2 minutes to one arriving every 0 to 5.
I changed the number of items a checker can ring in from 10 per minute to between 8 and 12.
I changed the number of cashiers from 5 to 2.

I changed the time it takes to shop, as different items can take longer to collect depending on where they are and the aptitude of the shopper.
I altered the time between shoppers arriving because some can arrive simultateously while it may be a greater amount of time between others.
I changed the speed that checkers can scan items as some larger items like water and what not take longer to ring in as they must be physically scanned,
while other small items can be scanned quickly and duplicate items can be scanned repeatedly, increasing the speed.
I changed the number of checkers so the idle time wouldn't be so insanely high and the company isn't needlessly hemorraging money on useless employees.

Using the random values for some of the variables created more variance between runs.  This is to be expected, as there is more that can change when
there are more random events.  The more randomness that is added, the further it is from just a mathematical equation and the closer it is to 
'reality', even though it is still quite far from the real world (as the customers would theoretically be willing to wait for mulitple days or even 
years at their carts without leaving).
